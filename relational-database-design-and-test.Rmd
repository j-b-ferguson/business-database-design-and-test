# Background

The Happy Phone Company is a fictitious retailer of various makes and models of mobile phones. The business requires a new database to help manage data concerning employees, customers, suppliers, phones and contracts.

# Business Rules

__*The database must satisfy the following business rules:*__<br><br>

* Information about The Happy Phone Company employees includes an employee ID, name and position.

* Each customer of The Happy Phone Company is identified by a customer ID and has a name.

* Suppliers to The Happy Phone Company have a unique name and contact phone number.

* Phones stocked by The Happy Phone Company are described by a product code, retail price and stock quantity.

* Details of phones need to be kept, including make and model information.

* Contracts supplied by The Happy Phone Company are described by a contract number, contract term in months and contract price.

* A phone must have at least one supplier and each supplier can supply many phones. When a supplier supplies a phone, data includes a supply price, the quantity supplied and the date of the supply. If a supplier provides several supplies of a phone, only data for the most recent supply is kept.

* Details of a purchase by a customer shall include the date of purchase and a contract number (if applicable). A customer can purchase several phones in a single day and the details of each purchase must be kept.

# Functional Dependencies of the Business Rules

The first step in creating a relational database is to obtain the functional dependencies from the business rules. A functional dependency is a logical relationship between two sets of attributes X={X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub>} and Y={Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>, ..., Y<sub>n</sub>}, and must satisfy the criteria X &#8594; Y, where the arrow notation is read in plain english as <i>determine</i>. In other words, all attributes together in X determine any attribute in Y, and any attribute in Y must be related to those in X.
<br><br>
The following are the set of minimal basis functional dependencies drawn from the business rules:
<br><br>
<p class="border-p">
employee ID &#8594; employee name, position
<br><br>
customer ID &#8594; customer name
<br><br>
supplier name &#8594; phone number
<br><br>
product code &#8594; make, model, retail price, stock quantity
<br><br>
purchase number, contract number &#8594; contract term, contract price
<br><br>
supplier name, product code &#8594; supply price, supply quantity, supply date
<br><br>
purchase number &#8594; customer ID, product code, employee ID, purchase date
</p>

# Normalisation

The process of normalisation in database design removes data redundancy by measuring the goodness of a relational schema with respect to the <i>normal forms</i>. An important concept in normalisation is the <i>key</i> of a relation. For a functional dependency X &#8594; Y, a key is the set of attributes in X that completely determine the remaining attributes in Y of a relation.
<br><br>
The following points describe the levels of normal forms, where higher normal forms remove data redundancy more deeply.
<br><br>
<p class="border-p">
__*First Normal Form (1NF):*__ Attributes of a relation are atomic values and do not contain sets.
<br><br>
__*Second Normal Form (2NF):*__ Non-key attributes of a relation must be fully functionally dependent on a key.
<br><br>
__*Third Normal Form (3NF):*__ A functional dependency FD X &#8594; Y of a relation must have X as a candidate key or Y as part of a (possibly different) candidate key
<br><br>
__*Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):*__ A functional dependency FD X &#8594; Y where X is a key of the relation.
</p>
<br>
The standard for this database is either 3NF or BCNF. The keys of the relations inferred from the minimal set of functional dependencies above are {employee ID}, {customer ID}, {supplier name}, {product code}, {purchase number, contract number}, {supplier name, product code}, {purchase number}. With respect to the definitions above, the relations are all in BCNF.

# Modelling the Business Rules

Functional dependencies and normalisation were used to find the non-redundant relationships between the attributes and determine the appropriate keys. The next step is to find the cardinalities of the relations. These are the zero-many (0..\*), one-many (1..\*)and one-one (1..1) relationships that will later determine the constraints of the relational model. An entity-relationship diagram in UML format has been created below for this purpose. Note the Contract class is a weak-entity set and the solid diamonds represent associations (1..1 relationships) between classes.

```
</center>

# ER Model to Relational Database Schema Mapping

The ER diagram is a high-level design of the database. To obtain a low-level design, the diagram is mapped into a relational database schema, where underlined attributes represent primary keys, and attributes with asterisks represent foreign keys.
<br><br>
<p class="border-p">
Supplier(<ins>supplierName</ins>, contactPhone)
<br><br>
Supply(<ins>supplierName\*, productCode\*</ins>, supplyPrice, supplyQuantity, supplyDate)
<br><br>
Phones(<ins>productCode</ins>, make, model, stockQuantity, retailPrice)
<br><br>
Customer(<ins>custID</ins>, custName)
<br><br>
Purchase(<ins>purchaseNo</ins>, purchaseDate, custID\*, productCode\*, empID\*)
<br><br>
Contract(<ins>contractNo, purchaseNo\*</ins>, contractTerm, contractPrice)
<br><br>
Employee(<ins>empID</ins>, empName, position)
</p>

# Creating the Relational Database in Oracle with Dummy Data

Database tables have been created from the relational schema in Oracle SQL Developer with SQL `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements. Sample data has been created and inserted into these tables to allow for realistic testing later. The method used to create the sample data is briefly described [here](https://github.com/j-b-ferguson/business-database-design-and-test/blob/main/SQL%20code/README.md).

Below is an extract of the relational database SQL script, with a few `INSERT` statements included to show method. The complete script can be viewed [here](https://github.com/j-b-ferguson/business-database-design-and-test/blob/main/SQL%20code/The%20Happy%20Phone%20Company%20Relational%20Database.sql).

# Testing the Relational Database in Oracle with SQL Queries

A database must be able to handle SQL queries created by an employee based on questions derived from the business rules. Examples include:<br><br>

* Which employee had the most overall sales?

* Which customer purchased the most products in a given period?

* How many sales were made on a given date?

* How many phone contracts were sold as purchases on a given date?

* What is the most popular selling make and model of phone?

* What is the cost difference between retailPrice and average contractPrice for a given model of phone?

* What is the cost difference between supplyPrice and retailPrice for a given model of phone?

* Which supplier last supplied a particular model of phone?

* How many products were received on a given date?

<br>
The following SQL queries demonstrate the good design of the database to handle such questions.
<br>
