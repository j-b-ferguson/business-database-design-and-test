<h1><p align="center">Creating a Sample Data Set to Test the Relational Database with SQL Queries</p></h1>

The database must be thoroughly tested with business-related SQL queries before delivering the final product to the client. Therefore, realistic sample data has been created for this purpose as real-world data is not available. 

All realistic sample data has been generated at [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/). Example below:

Some attributes required simple random sampling to mimic the randomness of real-world data. For example, not all customers buy phone contracts. Therefore, simple random sampling has been performed to mimic random contract purchases by using the `RAND()` and `SORT` functions avaliable in Microsoft Excel. See below:
